How to start:
1. Download release version (.zip or .7z format)
2. Unpack the downloaded archive and start GinkEngine.bat
3. In the menu bar, click on "Options" and select "Link Puttler"
4. Select the games .exe file and it will then say that it has linked successfully. In the menu bar, go to Play -> Start modded, this will ensure BepInEx gets fully installed.
5. Game files will be cloned into "DONT_SHARE/Game Files", these are the game files you will modify. Linking also installs BepInEx by default.
6. If you want to restart the modding process, simply re-link the game the same way you did before and all modified files will go away.
