# GinkEngine
How to start:
1. Download release version (.zip or .7z format)
2. Unpack the downloaded archive and start GinkEngine.bat
3. In the menu bar, click on "Options" and select "Link Puttler"
4. Select the games .exe file and it will then say that it has linked successfully. In the menu bar, go to Play -> Start modded, this will ensure BepInEx gets fully installed.
5. Game files will be cloned into "DONT_SHARE/Game Files", these are the game files you will modify. Linking also installs BepInEx by default.
6. If you want to restart the modding process, simply re-link the game the same way you did before and all modified files will go away.

How to use:
Tab 1. Browse mods
    Use this tab to browse and installs user made mods that are uploaded on the servers. Downloaded mods will appear in the third tab("Install Mods")

Tab 2. Create mods
    Build the mods for public release, this process removes most game files to prevent piracy. You only need to use this tab when you actually release your mod to the servers, or when you want to save your mod. Changes in files are detected, so that the modified files can be downloaded and installed by others. Created mods are always free for others to use under a CC0 license, your work can always be built on by others or copied. 

Tab 3. Install mods
    Use this tab to install downloaded mods, non-BepInEx based mods might get overwritten by each other if you install multiple mods. Installing mods can be destructive to your already installed mods, so if you have a mod under development it's not recommended to install other mods as that might break your project. Make sure to use the Create mods tab to save your mod before installing other mods on top of it.
